## Version 0.1.2

[feat] - Adds the `onUserDeleted` function which is triggered by a user being deleted in Firebase Authentication. Upon user deletion the extension will delete their customer object in Stripe which will immediately cancel all subscriptions for the user.
[feat] - Adds the `onStoreDeleted` function which has the same effect as `onUserDeleted` but is triggered when the customer doc in the Cloud Firestore is deleted. This ensures compatibility with the [Delete User Data](https://firebase.google.com/products/extensions/delete-user-data) extension built by the Firebase team.

[fix] - Allow creation of a Stripe customer object without email address.
[fix] - Create Stripe customer object just in time to support users that existed before the extension was installed.

## Version 0.1.1

Version bump in preparation for public beta launch.

## Version 0.1.0
