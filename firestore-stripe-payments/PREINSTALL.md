Use this extension as a backend for your [Stripe](https://www.stripe.com/) payments.

The extension supports multiple use cases:

- Process one-time payments with [Stripe Checkout](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/checkout) on the web.
- Create subscriptions for your users and manage access control via Firebase Authentication.
- Process payments & set up payment methods with the mobile payment sheet on [Android](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=android&ui=payment-sheet), [iOS](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=ios&ui=payment-sheet), or with [React Native](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=react-native&ui=payment-sheet).

#### Subscription payments with Stripe Checkout

Users can sign-up for your digital goods and paid content with Stripe Checkout and manage their subscriptions with the Stripe customer portal.

This extension syncs customers' subscription status with your Cloud Firestore and adds custom claims using Firebase Authentication for convenient access control in your application.

The design for Stripe Checkout and the customer portal can be customized in your Stripe Dashboard [branding settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/branding). See this example which is customized to match the Firebase color scheme:

#### Recommended usage

If you're building on the web platform, you can use this extension for any of your payment use cases. 

If you're developing native mobile applications and you're selling digital products or services within your app, (e.g. subscriptions, in-game currencies, game levels, access to premium content, or unlocking a full version), you must use the app store's in-app purchase APIs. See [Apple's](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#payments) and [Google's](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9858738?hl=en&ref_topic=9857752) guidelines for more information. 

For all other scenarios you can use the [stripe-android](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-android), [stripe-ios](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-ios), [stripe-react-native](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-react-native), or [flutter_stripe](https://github.com/flutter-stripe/flutter_stripe) SDKs.

#### Client SDK

You can use the [`@stripe/firestore-stripe-payments`](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-firebase-extensions/blob/web-sdk/firestore-stripe-web-sdk/README.md)
JavaScript package to easily access this extension from web clients. This client SDK provides
TypeScript type definitions and high-level convenience APIs for most common operations client
applications would want to implement using the extension.

Use a package manager like NPM to install the above package, and use it in conjunction with
the Firebase Web SDK.

### Events

This extension emits events, which allows you to listen to and run custom logic at different trigger points during the functioning of the extension. For example you can listen to events when a product has been added via the `product.created` event, or whenever a payment has succeeded through the `invoice.payment_succeeded` event.
