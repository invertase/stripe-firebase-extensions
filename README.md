# UPDATE 2023-08-11:
This project is in the process of being transferred to [Invertase](https://github.com/invertase), who will maintain this extension going forward. Please see [this issue](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-firebase-extensions/issues/524) for more details. 
Once the transfer is complete, youâ€™ll need to uninstall the `stripe/firestore-stripe-payments` extension and install `invertase/firestore-stripe-payments` from the Firebase Extension Hub.
