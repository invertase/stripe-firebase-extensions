# Stripe Firebase Extensions

> The original @firebase/firestore-stripe-payments package was officially transferred to Invertase, but they do a lousy job of maintaining it. Critical PRs have been open for over two years.
> Use this version if you'd like ESM compatibility and a number of other improvements.

**Install the web SDK from npm** [`@trentrand/firestore-stripe-payments`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@trentrand/firestore-stripe-payments)
